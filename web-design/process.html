		<h1>Our Process</h1>
		<p class="first">
			The web industry is evolving at a staggering pace, and keeping up with all the latest tools and technologies is certainly a challenge.
		</p>
		<p>
			Over the years we've learnt that being the first to adopt a new technology doesn't always lead to a better product.
		</p>
		<p>
			We believe that taking a little time to observe new technologies–maybe play around with them in a side project–is often the best way to identify the things that provide true value. Those are the tools and technologies that we bring into our process.
		</p>

		<h2>Design-Lead Engineering</h2>
		<p>
			Many websites are designed to fit the tools that have come before them, we believe that this approach is wrong. We believe that the boundaries of design shouldn't be restricted by the content management systems and software packages that are available at the time.
		</p>
		<p>
			For us, the experience always comes first. If the tools we have don't allow us to build the experience we want, that's fine. We'll just build new ones.
		</p>

		<h2 id="responsive-web-design">Responsive Web Design</h2>
		<p>
			Responsive Web Design is the practice of building websites that can cautomatically adapt their design to best fit the device they are being viewed on.
		</p>
		<p>
			Browsing on mobile devices has increased rapidly over the past 3 years. Unfortunately many websites were not designed to be viewed on small screens and so provide a poor browsing experience. Building websites that are responsive allows us to ensure that the websites we build provide the best possible experience to visitors, regardless of the device they are using.
		</p>

		<h2>Speed + Performance</h2>
		<p>
			The performance of a website directly impacts the experience for the end user. Performance can be the difference between obtaining a loyal customer or losing them altogether.
		</p>
		<p>
			We have a number of measures in place to make sure that the applications we develop are fast. These measures include writing efficient code, utilising caching and compression technologies, and deploying to a highly scalable infrastructure.
		</p>

		<h2>Security</h2>
		<p>
			Your data is an important asset. It's our job to makes sure that applications we build take care of it.
		</p>
		<p>
			All of the code we write conforms to a set of strict security standards to ensure that your data stays safe.
		</p>

		<h2>Automated Testing</h2>
		<p>
			Automated testing involves writing computer programs that can test an application to ensure that it's functioning correctly. This is particularly important when building the sort of business-critical web applications that we develop.
		</p>
		<p>
			As well as maintaining a high level of automated test coverage, we also manually test our applications throughout the development process to ensure that everything is as robust as possible.
		</p>

		<h2>Ruby on Rails + PHP + Go</h2>
		<p>
			We focus on building websites using three main languages. Ruby on Rails, PHP, and Go.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Ruby programming language and Rails development framework (hance Ruby on Rails) allow us to create incredibly robust web applications in a fraction of the time that it would take us if we used another language.
		</p>
		<p>
			PHP has been a widely used programming language on the web for many years. We mainly use it for creating marketing websites. Many of the content management systems we deal with also use PHP.
		</p>
		<p>
			Go is an emerging programming language that was developed by Google to help them build highly-scalable applications. We use Go within some of our larger projects to handle resource-intensive computational tasks like image processing.
