		<h1>Our Process</h1>
		<p class="first">
			Thinking of working with us?
		</p>
		<p>
			Here we've outlined our process for a website project to give you an idea of what to expect if you chose to work with us.
		</p>

		<dl class="numbered">
			<dt>Requirements Gathering</dt>
			<dd>
				Every project starts out with an intial conversation about your needs and what specific goals you wish to accomplish.
			</dd>
			
			<dt>Proposal</dt>
			<dd>
				Once we've established your requirements we'll put together a proposal outlining the best solution to achieve your goals. This is then refined until everyone is happy with the scope and cost of the project.
			</dd>

			<dt>Design</dt>
			<dd>
				After you've accepted the proposal we'll get to work on the design for your new website. You'll be given access to our project management tool Basecamp so we can share designs and collect your feedback.
			</dd>

			<dt>Development</dt>
			<dd>
				Once the design has been approved we'll build all the technical stuff that powers your website. If you've agreed to provide content, we'll need it before we can get started on this stage.
			</dd>

			<dt>Final Review</dt>
			<dd>
				By this point your new website is built and ready to go. We'll arrange a chat to review the site and go through any last minute changes that need to be made.
			</dd>

			<dt>Launch!</dt>
			<dd>
				Now for the most exciting bit! We'll set your new website free and submit it to search engines. We like to launch at the start of the week so you have plenty of time to show it off to others before the weekend comes around.
			</dd>

			<dt>Post-Launch Review</dt>
			<dd>
				We'll schedule a meeting or call a short while after the launch to discuss how well your new website's performing against your original goals.
			</dd>
		</dl>

		<h2>Keeping You Informed</h2>
		<p>
			Communication is key. We like to keep our clients constantly up-to-date with the progress of their project with us.
		</p>
		<p>
			One of the ways we do this is through <a href="https://basecamp.com" target="_blank">Basecamp</a>. Basecamp allows you to check-in and see progress in real-time. You'll also receive an email every morning with a summary of the work from the day before, just in case you missed anything.
