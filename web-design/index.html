		<h2>Designing Experiences</h2>
		<p>
			Great design is key to communicating a professional and consistent brand to your customers. But design isn't just about how something looks. Great design encompasses both form and functionality.
		</p>
		<p>
			We spend a lot of time planning user experiences. How visitors will move between pages, and how they will interact with elements on a page. This detailed exploration allows us to deliver experiences that delight users.
		</p>

		<h2 id="responsive-web-design">Responsive Web Design</h2>
		<p>
			We live in a time where we're surrounded by connected devices. Computers, phones, tablets, all these creations have access to the internet. But their form requires the need for tailored experiences.
		</p>
		<p>
			We follow a design method known as Responsive Web Design. Which allows us to deliver the best possible experience to visitors across a wide range of devices.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Looking Forward</h2>
		<p>
			The web is always evolving and we do our best to keep up with the latest technologies and best practices. We like to look forward, so all our projects follow the latest HTML5 and CSS3 web standards.
		</p>
		<p>
			We're big fans of the popular development framework <a href="http://rubyonrails.org" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a>, and use it for most of our projects.
		</p>
		<p>
			Many of our projects require bespoke solutions. But we also have experience with popular off-the-shelf solutions like <a href="http://wordpress.org" target="_blank">WordPress</a> and <a href="http://grabaperch.com" target="_blank">Perch</a>.
