		<h2>Design-Lead Engineering</h2>
		<p>
			Many websites are designed to fit the tools that have come before them, I believe that this approach is wrong. I don't believe that the boundaries of design should be restricted by the content management systems and software packages that are available at the time.
		</p>
		<p>
			I put aesthetic and experience design first and am not afraid of building new tools to enable these design decisions.
		</p>

		<h2>Responsive Web Design</h2>
		<p>
			Responsive Web Design is the practice of building websites that automatically adjust and restyle themselves in order to provide the optimal experience for users browsing your website on various devices.
		</p>
		<p>
			Browsing on mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets has increased rapidly over the past 3 years. The problem is that many websites were not designed for viewing on small screens and therefore the user has to endure a poor browsing experience. Building websites that are responsive, and can automatically adapt their styling and layout for the screen they are being viewed on, allows you to ensure that you are providing a high quality browsing experience to all of your users, regardless of what device they are using.

		<h2>Speed + Performance</h2>
		<p>
			The performance of websites and web applications directly impacts the experience of the end user and can be the difference between obtaining a loyal customer or losing them altogether.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have a number of measures in place to make sure that the applications I develop run quickly and smoothly. These measures include writing efficient code, utilising caching and compression technologies and deploying to a highly scalable infrastructure.
		</p>

		<h2>Security</h2>
		<p>
			Your data is an important asset and it is my job to makes sure that I build applications that can take care of it. All of my code must conform to a set of security standards in order to ensure that there are no security holes in the applications that I develop.
		</p>
		<p>
			For larger projects I also have a team of ethical hackers that can be used to comprehensively test applications.
		</p>

		<h2>Automated Testing</h2>
		<p>
			Automated testing involves writing computer programs that can test your applications to make sure that they are functioning correctly. This is particularly important when you are building the sort of large-scale web applications that I develop.
		</p>
		<p>
			As well as maintaining a high level of automated test coverage I also manually test our applications before they go live to ensure that everything is as robust as possible.

			<h2>HTML5 Foundations</h2>

				Matt West (founder of Koji Labs) quite literally wrote the book on how to build websites using HTML5.
