		<h1>Web Development</h1>
		<p class="first">
			We're a specialist web development studio. We build everything from small brochure websites, up to business-critical web applications.
		</p>
		<p>
			The design for most of our projects is handled in-house, but we also play nicely with others if you have a specialist design firm in mind.
		</p>
		<p>
			We're big fans of the popular development framework <a href="http://rubyonrails.org" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a>, and use it for most of our projects.
		</p>
		<p>
			The web is always evolving and we do our best to keep up with the latest technologies and best practices. We like to look forward, so all of our projects follow the latest HTML5 and CSS3 web standards.
		</p>
		<p>
			A lot of our projects require us to build something from scratch, but we also have experience with popular off-the-shelf solutions like <a href="http://wordpress.org" target="_blank">WordPress</a> and <a href="http://grabaperch.com" target="_blank">Perch</a>.
