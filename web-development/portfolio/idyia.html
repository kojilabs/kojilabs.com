			Idyia Coaching &amp; Development approached us in late 2013 to give their website a fresh new look.
		</p>
		<p>
			Using an assortment of cutting-edge technologies, we created a website that embodies the personality of the Idyia brand. The website incorporates responsive design, providing the visitor with the best possible experience, regardless of the device they are using.

			One of the requirements set out in our initial meetings with Idyia, was the need for a blog that the company could use to share opinions and insights with customers. We integrated the site with the popular content management system <a href="http://grabaperch.com" target="_blank">Perch</a>. This not only allows Idyia to manage their own blog, but also gives them full control over all of the other content on the site.
