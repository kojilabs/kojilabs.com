			LOCARN launched a business that aimed to take on traditional courier services by offering customers the ability to schedule an hourly slot for when their parcel would be delivered.
		</p>
		<p>
			LOCARN approached us to build a three-sided web application that would handle the company's entire technical infrastructure.
		</p>
		<p>
			We delivered a Ruby on Rails application that consisted of a marketing site for signing up new customers; a customer portal which allowed customers to schedule and pay for their deliveries; and a management portal that tracked parcels as they progressed through the company's warehouse.

			Developing such a business-critical system naturally attracts many technical challenges. We successfully overcame all of the challenges we encountered and delivered a robust web application.

			Sadly LOCARN are no longer trading, but this remains one of the projects we are most proud of.
