Knowledge is power. I’m a big fan of sharing the knowledge I’ve acquired in the interest of helping others to further their skills. In the past I’ve written for great companies like [Treehouse](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/author/mattwest) and [Postach.io](http://blog.postach.io) but in recent months I’ve fell somewhat silent.

That’s about to change!

Writing blog posts, tutorials, and technology breakdowns is not only a rewarding way to engage with the web community, it’s also a great way for me to keep up-to-date with the latest tech. I learn so much from writing technical articles that I think it’s about time I started up a regular blog of my own.

From now on the new Koji Labs code blog (found at <http://code.kojilabs.com>) is the main place I’ll be sharing quick tips, tutorials, and tech-related opinion pieces.

I’m just getting started and have a long list of topics I want to cover over the coming weeks and months, but I also want to here from you!

What topics would you like to see covered on the blog?

Let me know in the comments or drop an email to matt.west@kojilabs.com
