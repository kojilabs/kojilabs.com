<p><span>After exploring a number of alternative routes, today I must announce that Kojitsu will be </span><strong>shutting down on July 11th</strong><span>.</span></p>
<p>Kojitsu was built to solve a need I had for discovering great content through the noisy feeds on social networking sites. It accomplished that goal, and I'm immensely proud of what we as a community have built. The feedback and guidance offered by users helped to make Kojitsu infinitely better than it would have been if I embarked on this journey alone.</p>
<p>I'd like to thank everyone that signed up to Kojitsu, and especially those that gave up their valuable time to offer feedback.</p>
<p>If you have any questions&ndash;or would just like to chat&ndash;feel free to drop me an <a href="mailto:matt.west@kojilabs.com">email me</a> or catch me on <a href="https://twitter.com/MattAntWest">twitter</a>.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>
<h3><strong>Will things continue to work until July 11th?</strong></h3>
<p>Yes, the service will continue on as normal until July 11th. You'll still receive your daily summary emails, and the site will still be accessible. However, you will no longer be able to sign up for the service.</p>
<h3><strong>What will happen to my data?</strong></h3>
<p>All user data will be destroyed on July 11th.</p>
<h3><strong>What does this mean for Koji Labs?</strong></h3>
<p>Koji Labs will continue on. In fact, there's already some new products under development that will be launching later this year.</p>
<h3><strong>Why is Kojitsu shutting down?</strong></h3>
<p>I'll write about this decision in more detail in the coming weeks.<br /> To briefly sum up, Kojitsu isn't able to generate the revenue needed to keep the servers running. The only viable option would be to make Kojitsu ad-supported and I'm not a huge fan of turning <em>you</em> (the users) into the <em>product</em>.</p>
