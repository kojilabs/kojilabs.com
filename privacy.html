		<h1>Privacy</h1>
		<p class="first">
			Your privacy is really important to us (seriously), so in addition to the usual lawyer speak, we thought we'd set out some of our privacy values in a way that wouldn't send you to sleep.

			<dt>Browsing Privacy</dt>
			<dd>
				Nobody likes to have someone looking over their shoulder whilst they're browsing the internet so we've made sure that our website uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer" target="_blank">SSL</a>. This makes sure that the connection between you and our website is secure, so any information you send will only be seen by us. Oh, and any data you do send us we keep super safe and don't share with anyone.
			</dd>
			<dt>Analytics + User Tracking</dt>
			<dd>
				We use <a href="http://google.com/analytics" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a> on our website which allows us to see anonymous data about how visitors use the site, and the pages that are most popular. Most people will tell you that they use this information to make their website better, and we do that too, but it's also because <a href="https://twitter.com/MattAntWest" target="_blank">Matt</a> just likes looking at the pretty charts.
			</dd>
			<dt>Data Liberation</dt>
			<dd>
				Your data is yours! Losing a customer really sucks, but if you decide to 
				go elsewhere we'll do everything we can to make sure the switch goes smoothly.
				We strive to build features into our products that make it easy for you to get 
				your data out (or put it back in again!).
