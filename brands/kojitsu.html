		<p class="first">
			<a href="https://kojitsu.com">Kojitsu</a> was a web application that analysed your Twitter and Facebook feeds to find the best content your friends were sharing.
		</p>
		<p>
			The product was born out of a personal need for a tool that could cut through the noise of social feeds and find the content that we would actually be interested in.

			Recommendations were delivered via a morning email, with on-demand recommendations available online. The app had integrations with many popular services such as Pocket, Instapaper, and Buffer.

			We learnt a great deal from building and operating Kojitsu. Although we ultimately decided to close the service in July 2014, there's no doubt that the lessons we learned from Kojitsu have helped us to make better products.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our greatest acheivment with Kojitsu was keeping the product simple. We were lucky enough to attract an incredible group of users to the product; many of whom commented on how the simplicty of the product was refreshing, and made Kojitsu stand out amongst it's competitors.
