		<h1>Manifesto</h1>
		<p class="first">
			We believe that business is about more than just making money.
		</p>
		<p>
			Businesses have the power to change the world. To improve people's lives. To make each day that little bit more delightful.
		</p>
		<p>
			In order to stay true to this belief, we wrote the <em>Koji Labs Manifesto</em>; a collection of thoughts and ideas that sum up how we want to do business.
		</p>

		<dl class="numbered">
			<dt>Simplicity</dt>
			<dd>
				Simplicity is at the heart of everything we do. From how we design websites, to how we write code, we truly believe that simplicity is the key to creating intuitive products that stand the test of time.
			</dd>

			<dt>Experience</dt>
			<dd>
				When creating products that will be used by a wide range of people, the experience really is everything. We believe that simple, intuitive design leads to rich experiences that truly surprise and delight customers.
			</dd>

			<dt>Attention to Detail</dt>
			<dd>
				Getting the small things absolutely right is a big part of what makes good products great. For us, &#8220;good enough&#8221; just won't cut it, we care too much.
			</dd>

			<dt>Design-Lead Engineering</dt>
			<dd>
				Making great products isn't easy. Technical challenges often come up during the development process that can threaten the design of a product. We never make comprimises based on technical limitations without first hunting down every possible solution available. 
			</dd>

			<dt>Longevity</dt>
			<dd>
				We're in this for the long-haul, and as such we're very conscious of the long-term implications of any decisions we make. We've never been a fan of fads. Whether that's in design or business. We strive to do what's right for the long-term health of the business, even if that means leaving some money on the table.
			</dd>

			<dt>Sharing</dt>
			<dd>
				Good education can change people's lives. We strive to be open, and to share our knowledge with those around us to both educate and help push our industry forward.
			</dd>

			<dt>Embracing Change</dt>
			<dd>
				The web industry is constantly evolving and reinventing itself, and that's a great thing. We aim to always keep up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices to ensure we're building the best products possible.
			</dd>

			<dt>Environmental Responsibility</dt>
			<dd>
				We care deeply about the environment and doing everything we can to help protect it. It's our responsibility to ensure that the decisions we make do not diminish the beautiful world that surrounds us.
			</dd>

			<dt>Fun!</dt>
			<dd>
				Last but not least, we want to have fun! Because life's too short to settle for just &#8220;okay&#8221;. <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>
